			<p>Our offering is focused around two solution groups: “productive workplace” and “scale with cloud innovation”. Productive Workplace is built on Microsoft 365 and includes a wide-variety of tools to bring everyone in an organisation together to achieve more.  With Scale with Cloud Innovation we offer Microsoft Azure’s public cloud solutions, private cloud setups and a combination of both and the existing on-premise.</p>

			<p>Our biggest added value is in managed services. We offer these on our private cloud, and now we do on Azure as well. We completely rebuilt these from the ground up, to fit the opportunities the Azure cloud offers in terms of management, maintenance, monitoring, security and automation. The result is Azure managed services: a futureproof managed service offering.</p>
