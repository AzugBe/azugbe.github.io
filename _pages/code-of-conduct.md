All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our user group events and conferences are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. AZUG will enforce this code throughout user group events and conferences. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

Our user group events and conferences aim to provide an environment where everyone can participate in an inclusive, respectful, and safe manner. We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for all event participants. We expect all attendees, speakers, sponsors, the event team, and the program committee to show respect and courtesy to the other participants

Your registration for or attendance at our user group events or conference indicates your agreement to abide by this policy and its terms.

**Expected Behavior**

All event participants, whether they are attending an in-person event or a virtual event, are expected to behave according to professional standards, with both this Code of Conduct and their respective employer’s policies governing appropriate workplace behavior and applicable laws.

**Unacceptable Behavior**

Harassment and offensive behavior will not be tolerated in any form, whether in person or virtually, including, but not limited to, harassment based on gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or any other status protected by laws in which the conference or program is being held.

Harassment includes the use of abusive, offensive, or degrading language, intimidation, stalking, harassing photography or recording, inappropriate physical contact, sexual imagery, and unwelcome sexual advances or requests for sexual favors. Any report of harassment at one of our events, whether in person or virtual, will be addressed immediately. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Anyone who witnesses or is subjected to unacceptable behavior should notify a conference organizer or a working group member at once.

Speakers and sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material in their presentations or booths. They must refrain from using sexualized clothing, uniforms, costumes, or otherwise creating a sexualized environment.

Individuals who participate (or plan to participate) in the conference, whether in-person or virtually, should conduct themselves at all times in a manner that comports with both the letter and spirit of this policy prohibiting harassment and abusive behavior, whether before, during, or after the event. This includes statements made in social media postings, online publications, text messages, and other electronic communication forms.

**Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior**

Breaches of this Code of Conduct may result in disqualification from participating in the registered event without a refund, and potentially be disqualified from future live and virtual events.

**Talk to Us**

We care about making AZUG and our events a safe space for everyone. If you need help, if you see or experience something that seems inappropriate or makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or uncomfortable, or want to get in touch about any related concerns, please tell us. Our team will respond to inquiries as soon as possible. If you feel comfortable enough or prefer to report an issue in-person, find anyone from the organization.

* E-mail: contact us via [help@azug.be](mailto:help@azug.be?subject=Code-of-conduct)

This will inform several people at once.

**Pre-Event Concerns**

If you plan to attend the upcoming event, whether in-person or virtually and have concerns regarding another individual who may be present, please get in touch with us via [help@azug.be](mailto:help@azug.be?subject=Code-of-conduct). Precautions will be taken to ensure your comfort and safety, including, but not limited to, providing an escort, prepping onsite event staff, keeping victim and harasser from attending the same talks/social events, and providing onsite contact cell phone numbers for immediate contact.

Thank you for helping us make this a welcoming and friendly environment for all.
