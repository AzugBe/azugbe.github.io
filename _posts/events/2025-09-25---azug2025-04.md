## Agenda

### Getting Started with Agentic AI using Azure AI Agent Service

<img src="/assets/media/speakers/stijn-castelyns.jpg" alt="Stijn Castelyns" align="right" height="100" width="100" style="margin-right: 20px;">
Dive into the world of Agentic AI, where intelligent systems act autonomously to solve complex problems. While powerful, building and deploying these agents securely and reliably in real-world environments presents unique challenges. This session introduces the Azure AI Agent Service, a managed platform designed to accelerate the development and deployment of stateful, enterprise-ready AI agents. Learn how this service helps orchestrate Azure tools like Azure OpenAI, Logic Apps, Functions, and Azure AI Search to enable planning, tool use, and secure data grounding with various models. Join us to understand the core concepts and take your first steps in building sophisticated agentic solutions on the Azure platform.

Integration is no longer just about connecting systems—it’s about making them smarter. In this session, we’ll explore how AI is reshaping Azure Integration Services, from intelligent API management and anomaly detection in Service Bus, to AI-driven workflows in Logic Apps. 
Whether you’re an architect, developer, or decision-maker, you’ll learn practical scenarios where AI enhances performance, governance, and decision-making in modern integration platforms.
