For our third session this year we are teaming up with delaware.
We invite you to experience Microsoft Build togheter with some streetfood, drinks & snacks.

## Agenda 

Check <a href="https://www.delaware.pro/en-be/careers/events/microsoft-build-watch-party-2025" target="_blank">Microsoft Build Watch Party 2025</a> for more information!

The yearly Microsoft Build is coming up! Can’t make it to Seattle, but plan on watching from home? Togheter with delaware we’re hosting the third edition of our watch party, and you're invited. We’re opening up our offices to again join and experience Microsoft Build together. Because when it comes to geeking out over a Microsoft Keynote, “the more, the merrier” definitely counts.   

Happy to note that this year we're partnering up with AZUG as our co-host, to give you not just livestreamed keynotes, but also short & sweet in-person tech sessions by delaware, AZUG & Microsoft speakers. A cosy & casual evening full of knowledge sharing among peers - registrations below!
