## Agenda

### Honey, I shrunk the DEV team...

What happens when a team based effort suddenly changes into a solo endeavor? How does a one-man-does-all compare to a divided effort? This session entails my experience in a project where exactly this happened, and reports on my findings.

**Speakers: Wouter Vercruysse**

### Azure Belgium Central

Jan and I are thrilled to be part of the exciting launch of the Azure Belgium Central region, set to open in 2025! ðŸŽ‰

In our session, we'll unveil exclusive details about the datacenter's timeline and give you a behind-the-scenes look at how an Azure region is built, what it looks like, and the cutting-edge hardware that powers it (sorry, no location spoilers! ðŸ˜‰).

But that's not all! With Microsoft moving away from paired regions, we'll dive into designing for multi-region High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP). We'll share real-world examples and highlight the benefits of these modern architectures over the old paired region concepts.
With 4 years at Microsoft, Jan has taken on several roles, but is currently focusing on Data & AI with ISVs and, of course, the Azure Belgium Central region.
Wouter is already 3 years at Microsoft, focusing on Azure infrastructure in the public sector + Azure Belgium Central

**Speaker:  Wouter Gevaert & Jan Gezels**
