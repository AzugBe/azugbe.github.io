## Agenda

### Honey, I shrunk the DEV team...

What happens when a team based effort suddenly changes into a solo endeavor? How does a one-man-does-all compare to a divided effort? This session entails my experience in a project where exactly this happened, and reports on my findings.

**Speakers: Wouter Vercruysse**

### Azure Belgium Central

Jan and I are thrilled to be part of the exciting launch of the Azure Belgium Central region, set to open in 2025! 🎉

In our session, we'll unveil exclusive details about the datacenter's timeline and give you a behind-the-scenes look at how an Azure region is built, what it looks like, and the cutting-edge hardware that powers it (sorry, no location spoilers! 😉).

But that's not all! With Microsoft moving away from paired regions, we'll dive into designing for multi-region High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP). We'll share real-world examples and highlight the benefits of these modern architectures over the old paired region concepts.
With 4 years at Microsoft, Jan has taken on several roles, but is currently focusing on Data & AI with ISVs and, of course, the Azure Belgium Central region.
Wouter is already 3 years at Microsoft, focusing on Azure infrastructure in the public sector + Azure Belgium Central

**Speaker:  Wouter Gevaert & Jan Gezels**
