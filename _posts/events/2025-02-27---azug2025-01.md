It's true, AI Agents and Agentic AI are the buzzwords for 2025. In the real world though, AI agents can be very useful to perform tasks that are hard to do with more traditional approaches. In this session, we will look at what agents really are and dive into the best practices that make them work with Azure AI Foundry.
