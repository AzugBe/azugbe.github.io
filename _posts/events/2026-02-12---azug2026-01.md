Take your Azure Resource Management to the next level using Azure Deployment Stacks! 
In this session, we'll explore what deployment stacks are, see a live demo of implementing them, and discover their advantages over regular deployments—including enhanced governance, simplified updates and better resource lifecycle management.

**Speaker: Annelotte Mons - Senior Consultant @ Codit**

Are you working in a hybrid or multi‑cloud environment and facing some of the challenges below?

* Managing multiple environments while maintaining a clear overview of everything you’re running
* Efficiently monitoring the health, security, and updates of your services
* Dealing with multiple tools that serve the same purpose across different environments

In this session, we will explain and demonstrate how Azure Arc helps customers address these challenges and more. The goal is to make you familiar with Azure Arc, help you understand where it can add value to your business, and show you how to get started.

**Speaker:  Tom Claes - Cloud Solution Architect @ Microsoft**
