## About AZUG

AZUG is a Belgian user group with focus on development and architecture of Microsoft's Azure cloud platform. Our goal is to share knowledge and experiences with the .NET community on working with and developing for this platform.

There are many benefits to participating in AZUG:

* Learn best practices and optimal use of Microsoft's cloud platform
* Get answers, advice, tips and suggestions from experts and peers
* Gain new insights and ideas in how to apply Microsoft's cloud platform
